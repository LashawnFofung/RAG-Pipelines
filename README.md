# Retrieval Augumented Generation (RAG) Pipelines
This repository provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.  RAG is a critical architecture for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date, or private knowledge bases, effectively turning a generic AI into an expert on your specific data.

##

## 💡 Project Focus

The core of this project is using LlamaIndex—a powerful data framework designed to connect LLMs to external data—to create a high-performance, domain-specific AI chatbot.

##

## 🎯 Foundational Concepts

The foundational concepts to building a fully functional RAG application:

  - <b>RAG Fundamentals:</b> Gain a deep understanding of how RAG pipelines work and the core concepts of information retrieval and processing in the context of LLMs.

  - <b>LlamaIndex Mastery:</b> Learn to effectively use LlamaIndex for organizing, indexing, and efficiently searching through large, unstructured document sets.

  - <b>Model Integration:</b> Practice integrating open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) into the RAG workflow.

  - <b>Practical Application:</b> Build a functional, simple chatbot that uses the RAG pipeline to retrieve and synthesize relevant data for accurate, context-aware responses.
