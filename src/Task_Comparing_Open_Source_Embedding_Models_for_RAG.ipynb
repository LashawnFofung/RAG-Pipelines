I am testing three distinct values of top_k (Experiments B1-B3) to see how simply retrieving more context affects the final answer quality.

This model takes the top 8 chunks retrieved from the vector store and calculates a joint score based on the query and the chunk text fused together. It then aggressively filters the list, keeping only the best 3 (top_n=3).\n",
